This repository contains the implementation of a project for the "Model Order Reduction techniques" course. The goal is to develop and analyze data-driven **Reduced Order Models (ROMs)** to efficiently simulate the physical phenomenon of damage propagation in a U-bolt, governed by the **Fisher-KPP equation**.

The high computational cost of running traditional **Finite Element Method (FEM)** simulations‚Äîour Full Order Model (FOM)‚Äîmakes real-time analysis infeasible. To overcome this, we leverage data-driven ROMs, specifically **POD-NN** and **DL-ROM**, to create fast and accurate surrogate models.

## üöÄ Showcase & Results

### Model Performance & Speed-Up
The developed ROMs not only accurately predict the damage evolution but also provide a massive computational speed-up, making real-time parametric studies possible.

| Model | Avg. Relative L2 Error | Time for 1 Trajectory | Speed-up Factor |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FOM** | - | ‚âà 19.33 seconds | 1x |
| **POD-NN** | 4.82% | ‚âà 3.67 milliseconds | **~5200x** |
| **DL-ROM** | **2.78%** | *(similar to POD-NN)* | **~5000x+** |

### Parametric Study using the ROM
The trained ROM allows us to perform studies that would be too costly with the FOM. The plot below shows how the total damage ($J$) changes as a function of the material's reaction coefficient ($r$) for different initial damage locations ($\delta$).

## üîß How It Works

### 1. The Full Order Model (FOM)
The physical phenomenon is described by the time-dependent, non-linear Fisher-KPP equation.

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - D\Delta u = ru(1 - u) & \text{in } \Omega \times (0, T] \\
\nabla u \cdot \mathbf{n} = 0 & \text{on } \partial\Omega \times (0, T] \\
u(\cdot, 0) = g_{\delta} & \text{in } \Omega
\end{cases}
$$

The system is parameterized by $\boldsymbol{\mu} = [\mu_1, \mu_2, \mu_3]^T \in [0, 1]^3$, which control:
- **Diffusion coefficient**: $D = 10^{\mu_1}$
- **Reaction coefficient**: $r = 10^{\mu_2 + 2}$
- **Initial damage location**: $\delta = \mu_3 + 1$

The project uses a pre-computed dataset of **100 FOM simulations**, each with **41 time snapshots** and **6636 degrees of freedom**.

### 2. Data-Driven Reduced Order Models (ROMs)
We explored two techniques, splitting the data into 75 trajectories for training and 25 for testing.

#### A. POD-NN
This method combines a linear subspace projection with a neural network.
1.  **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD):** We use SVD to extract an optimal basis of **n=80** modes that capture **99.99%** of the data's energy.
2.  **Neural Network (NN):** A Deep Feedforward Neural Network learns the mapping from the input parameters $(\boldsymbol{\mu}, t)$ to the POD modal coefficients.

#### B. DL-ROM (Deep Learning ROM)
This is a non-linear approach using an autoencoder.
1.  **Autoencoder (AE):** An AE learns to compress the high-dimensional state into a low-dimensional latent space (**n=9**) and then reconstruct it.
2.  **Dynamics Network ($\Phi$):** A separate neural network predicts the evolution of the latent state based on the input parameters.

### 3. Analysis of the Quantity of Interest (QoI)
We analyzed the overall damage, defined by the functional $J(u) = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \int_\Omega u(\mathbf{x}, t) d\mathbf{x} dt$. The **POD-NN model** proved highly reliable in predicting this value, with a relative error of only **0.62%** on the test set.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the power of data-driven model order reduction for complex physical simulations.
- We developed two ROMs (**POD-NN** and **DL-ROM**) that accurately model damage propagation.
- We achieved a computational **speed-up of over 5000x**, enabling real-time analysis.
- The **POD-NN** model, despite a slightly higher reconstruction error, proved more robust and reliable for predicting the integrated quantity of interest and for performing parametric studies.
